**WHAT IS IT?**

a fork bomb is a denial-of-service attack (Dos) (rabbit v!rus) wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, slowing down or crashing the system due to resource starvation. The system eventually becomes overloaded and is unable to respond to any input .
